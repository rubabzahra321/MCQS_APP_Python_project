# 🎮 Quiz Game (Python)

A simple **Python-based console quiz game** where players answer multiple-choice questions and receive a final score at the end. The project demonstrates the use of **tuples, lists, loops, and conditionals** in Python.

## 🏗️ How It Works

1. The game stores **questions, options, and answers** in tuples.
2. A loop iterates through the questions and displays the options.
3. Users input their guesses (`A`, `B`, `C`, or `D`).
4. The program checks correctness, updates the score, and shows the right answer if incorrect.
5. At the end, the game displays:
   - All correct answers
   - User’s guesses
